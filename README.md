Anomaly Detection In A Very Large Scale
PROJECT ABSTRACT :	Anomaly detection intends to help distinguish events that are pretty rare and/or are deviating from the norm. The idea behind using this algorithmic paradigm for anomaly detection consists of two main steps: learning the normal behaviour of the system (based on past data) and detecting anomalous behaviour in real-time (by processing real-time data).

INTRODUCTION	In generic terms, anomaly detection intends to help distinguish events that are pretty rare and/or are deviating from the norm. This is of high importance to the finance industry like in consumer banking, anomalies might be critical things â€” like credit card fraud. In other cases, an anomaly might be something that companies look for to leverage from it. Some of the other applications include Intrusions in communication networks, Fake news, and misinformation, Healthcare analysis, Industry damage detection, Manufacturing, Security and surveillance, etc.


CONCLUSION /FUTURE ENHANCEMENT	This concludes that applying deep learning algorithms on classical structured data machine learning problems will give promising results if designed well. Identifying the right algorithm, appropriate loss function and ideal dataset can help data scientists tap into deep learning and leverage its capabilities to boost performances on age-old approaches. The use case mentioned in this article is on financial transactions but the very idea of deep anomaly detection can be extended to other domains like manufacturing and marketing.
